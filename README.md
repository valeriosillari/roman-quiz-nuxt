# Roman Number Quiz | NuxtJS

by Valerio Sillari


## Task

A Roman Numerals Quiz.


## General

Set application with VueJS, especially with [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js)

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).


## Tech Stacks

- [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/)

- [Pug Lang](https://pugjs.org/)

- [Sass Lang](https://sass-lang.com//)


## Build Setup

```
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate

# deploy on Github pages
# set branch "gh-page" on github deploy options (in settings)
$ yarn deploy
```


## Notes

I set some constant for setting the range for the random numbers to guess.

The system is set for arriving until 1000, but because is a game and should be funny for the user I set until 10.

You can change the range just changing one constant.


## TODOs

- set prettier

- set btn restart on gameOver and EndGame for better UX
